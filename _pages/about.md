I am currently the [Quantum Initiative Fellow ](https://quantum.harvard.edu/post-doctoral-fellows) at the [Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature](https://hetg.physics.harvard.edu). My primary academic advisor is [Daniel Jafferis](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/jafferis). My research has been heavily influenced by several discussions with [Xi Yin](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/yin). Prior to my days at Harvard, I have pursued my graduate studies under the guidace of [Shiraz Minwalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_Minwalla).
