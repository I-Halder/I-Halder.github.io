I am currently the [Quantum Initiative Fellow ](https://quantum.harvard.edu/post-doctoral-fellows) at the [Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature](https://hetg.physics.harvard.edu), Harvard University. My primary academic advisor is [Daniel Jafferis](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/jafferis). Prior to my days at Harvard, I pursued my graduate studies under the guidance of [Shiraz Minwalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_Minwalla). 

# Primary research interest

My current research interest includes understandig the microscopic origin of various macroscopic gravitational objects such as black khole, black ring etc with primary focus on their thermodynamic and out-of-equilibrium entangelemnt properties.  

## Thermal phyics of small and large stringy black hole

Through the lens of holography, geometric properties of a gravitational theory in AdS get related to the entanglement of the conformal field theories on its boundary - this fact often goes by the name of ER=EPR. During my early days at Harvard, I established a new strong-weak duality on the worldsheet of strings in AdS<sub>3</sub> that is closely related to ER=EPR. Essentially the duality allows one to obtain a winding condensate description of the BTZ black hole (the large black hole in AdS<sub>3</sub>). Utilizing such a description, I have been able to formulate an infinitesimally off-shell worldsheet technique (conceptually it is related to the Lewkowycz-Maldacena replica trick on the bulk) to calculate the thermal entropy of the blackhole from the first principle worldsheet calculation at weak strings coupling. Recently, such formalism is generalized for the application to Schwarzschild blackhole in large spacetime dimensions. 

The winding condensate description of the strings in thermal AdS<sub>3</sub> mentioned above allowed the study of condensation of nearly marginal winding tachyon on the Euclidean time circle near Hagedorn temperature perturbatively directly from the worldsheet. Away from the Hagedorn temperature, the perturbation theory breaks down. At Hawking-Page temperature, I studied a specific double winding condensate CFT and conjected it to be continuously connected to the perturbative solution mentioned above as we increase the temperature. This double winding condensate CFT is expected to describe a small stringy blackhole in AdS<sub>3</sub>.
