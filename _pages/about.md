Indranil Halder currently holds an associate researcher position at Harvard University. Earlier, he was the Quantum Initiative Fellow at the Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature. He is also affiliated with the Center for Quantum Mathematics and Physics at the University of California, Davis. 

# Research Interest
His central research interest lies in theoretical mathematical physics. 

He worked extensively on theoretical developments of topological quantum computation, more precisely on Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to matter. He discovered a condensed phase and pointed out an exact non-commutative structure in these theories in the presence of a background magnetic field. 

During his early days at Harvard, he established a new strong-weak duality closely related to ER=EPR - the fascinating connection between entanglement and geometry. Using the duality he has made distinct progress on the long-standing issue of thermal microstate counting in gravitational systems.
