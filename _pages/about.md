I am currently the [Quantum Initiative Fellow ](https://quantum.harvard.edu/post-doctoral-fellows) at the [Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature](https://hetg.physics.harvard.edu), Harvard University. My primary academic advisor is [Daniel Jafferis](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/jafferis). My research has been heavily influenced by several discussions with [Xi Yin](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/yin). Prior to my days at Harvard, I have pursued my graduate studies under the guidance of [Shiraz Minwalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_Minwalla).

#### Geometry and entanglement

Long range entanglement in quantum field theories provide the theoretical playground for the fault-tolerant quantum computation. Prototype field theory featuring such entanglement structure includes Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to matter fields. During my graduate studies I have extensively investigated properties of such theories and discoved the existance of the new Higged phases. When such a theory is placed in an external uniform magnetic field, it features a non-commutative structure at all energy scales. Taking advantage of the non-commutative structure I have found an `exact' solution for the rich band structure at non-zero chemical potential.

Through the lens of holography, geometric properties of a gravitational theory in AdS gets related to entanglement of the conformal field theories on its boundary - this fact often goes by the name of ER=EPR. During my early days at Harvard, I established a new strong-weak duality on the worldsheet of strings in AdS(3) that is closely related to ER=EPR. Essentially the duality allowes one to obtain a winding condensate description of the BTZ blackhole (the large blackhole in AdS(3)). Utilizing such a description, I have been able to formula an infinitesimally off-shell worldsheet technique (conceptually it is related to the Lewkowycz-Maldacena replica trick on the bulk) to calculate the thermal entropy of the blackhole from first principle worldsheet calculation at weak strings coupling. Recently, such the formalism is generalized for the application to Schwarzschild blackhole in large spacetime dimensions.
