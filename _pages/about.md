I am currently the [Quantum Initiative Fellow ](https://quantum.harvard.edu/post-doctoral-fellows) at the [Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature](https://hetg.physics.harvard.edu). My primary academic advisor is [Daniel Jafferis](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/jafferis). My research has been heavily influenced by several discussions with [Xi Yin](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/yin). Prior to my days at Harvard, I have pursued my graduate studies under the guidance of [Shiraz Minwalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_Minwalla). 

Research interests
======

# A
My theoretical physics research interest includes understanding the quantum nature of entanglement in gravitational and non-gravitational systems. 

During his early days at Harvard, I established a new strong-weak duality closely related to ER=EPR - the fascinating connection between entanglement and geometry. More recently, he has made distinct progress on the long-standing issue of evaluation of thermal entropy from a microscopic analysis in gravitational systems. In the past, he worked extensively on theoretical developments of topological quantum computation, more precisely on Chern-Simons theory coupled to fundamental matter. He studied new Higgsed phases and discovered a non-commutative structure in these theories in the presence of a background magnetic field. He has also pursued the discussion of winding tachyon condensation in AdSâ‚ƒ that is relevant for thermal microstates of a likely small black object and identified an entropic transition between a black hole and a black ring in the context of Calabi-Yau compactification.
